# Rabbit game

I was inspired by puzzle about rabbit (sometimes it's fox) hiding in holes.
It's question from Microsoft and Google interview (information from the internet).

Consider five holes in a line. One of them is occupied by a fox. Each night, the fox moves to a neighboring hole, either to the left or to the right. Each morning, you get to inspect a hole of your choice. What strategy would ensure that the fox is eventually caught?
